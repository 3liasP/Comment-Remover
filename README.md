# Comment-Remover
A simple C program that removes comments from a given .c file and saves the uncommented version as another file.

## Usage
To use this program, compile it using a C compiler such as GCC or Clang, then run it with the filename of the input file as the first command-line argument. The program will create a new file with the same name as the input file, but with "_no_comments" appended to the end of the filename.

For example, if the input file is called "example.c", you would run the program like this:

`./comment_remover example.c`

This command would create a new file called "example_no_comments.c" with all comments removed!
